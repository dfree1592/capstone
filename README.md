### This Project Analyze What Factors Make a Probowl Punter

###### What I was trying to was predict whether or no a punter in the NFL will make the Pro Bowl for that season. I wanted to focus on punters in the NFL because I believe them to have the most influence on how the rest of the game is going to play out. A Punter can dramatically change the game plan for the opposing team. If he punts the ball within 20 yards from the end zone (Red Zone) it will limit the types of plays that the offense will run, giving the defense an advantage. There are other multiple statistics that could determine what makes a Pro Bowl punter. The data suggests that best way to predict this would be through Decision Trees because they are a very powerful machine learning model. I also used Bagged Decision Trees and Random Forests
